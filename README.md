# Face-Recognizer-Application
This project is a face recognition application built using Python, Tkinter, and TensorFlow. The application allows users to take photos, train a model that recognizes those faces, and view the results in real-time.

## Features
*Photo Taking: Users can take photos using their webcam.
*Face Comparison: The application uses a pre-trained deep learning model to compare faces and recognize individuals.
*User-friendly Interface: The GUI is built using Tkinter, providing a simple and intuitive user interface.

##Technologies Used
*Python
*Tkinter
*TensorFlow
*OpenCV

##Installation
*Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-project.git
*Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
*Run the application: python main.py

##Future Enhancements
  Add support for more advanced face recognition algorithms.
  Improve the user interface for a more seamless experience.
